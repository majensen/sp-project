        "This jupyter notebook can be run on any computer with a standard browser and no prior installation of any programming language is required. It can run remotely over the Internet, free of charge, thanks to Google Colaboratory. To connect with Colab, click on one of the two blue checkboxes above. Check that \"colab\" appears in the address bar. You can right-click on \"Open in Colab\" and select \"Open in new tab\" if the left click does not work for you. Familiarize yourself with the drop-down menus near the top of the window. You can edit the notebook during the session, for example substituting your own image files for the image files used in this demo. Experiment by changing the parameters of functions. It is not possible for an ordinary user to permanently change this version of the notebook on GitHub or Colab, so you cannot inadvertently mess it up. Use the notebook's File Menu if you wish to save your own (changed) notebook.\n",

        "Each WSI can contain up to million nuclei of various types, which can be further analysed systematically and used for predicting clinical outcomes. In order to use nuclear features for downstream analysis within computational pathology, nucleus segmentation and classification must be carried out as an initial step. However, this remains a challenge because nuclei display a high level of heterogeneity and there is significant inter- and intra-instance variability in the shape, size and chromatin pattern between and within different cell types, disease types or even from one region to another within a single tissue sample. Tumour nuclei, in particular, tend to be present in clusters, which gives rise to many overlapping instances, providing a further challenge for automated segmentation, due to the difficulty of separating neighbouring instances.\n",

        "In this example, we will demonstrate how you can use the TIAToolbox implementation of [HoVer-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06499.pdf) to tackle these challenges and solve the problem of nuclei instance segmentation and classification within histology images. HoVer-Net is a deep learning approach based on horizontal and vertical distances (and hence the name HoVer-Net) of nuclear pixels to the centre of mass of the corresponding nucleus. These distances are used to separate clustered nuclei. For each segmented instance, the nucleus type is subsequently determined via a dedicated up-sampling branch.\n",

        "In this example notebook, we are not going to explain how HoVer-Net works (for more information we refer you to the [HoVer-Net paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841519301045)), but we will show how easily you can use the sophisticated HoVer-Net model, which is incorporated in TIATtoolbox, to do automatic segmentation and classification of nucleus instances. Mostly, we will be working with the [NucleusInstanceSegmentor](https://github.com/TissueImageAnalytics/tiatoolbox/blob/develop/tiatoolbox/models/engine/nucleus_instance_segmentor.py#L256) which by default uses one of the pretrained [HoVerNet](link_to_hovernet_dcoumentation) models. We will also cover the [visualisation tool](https://tia-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/develop/usage.html?#module-tiatoolbox.utils.visualization) embedded in TIAToolbox for overlaying the instance segmentation results on the input image.\n",
